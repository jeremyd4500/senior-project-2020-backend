## Front-end Setup

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Make sure you have the latest version of npm by running `npm i -g npm` in a terminal window.
3. **Recommended**: Install `yarn` by running `npm i -g yarn`.
4. Navigate to `src/frontend/` in a terminal.
5. Install necessary node modules by running `yarn` or `npm i`.
6. To run the app in developer mode, run `yarn start` or `npm run start`. After it starts, open up `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.
7. To build the app, run `yarn build` or `npm run build`. After that completes, you should see a new folder withing the `frontend` folder called `build`.
